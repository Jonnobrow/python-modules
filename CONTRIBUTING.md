## Development

This project uses `uv` for environment management.

First, you will need to install [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

After installing `uv`, you can run the following command:

```bash
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate
```

This will create and activate a virtual environment in the `.venv` directory.

You will now be able to run development tools like `ruff` and `pytest`.
